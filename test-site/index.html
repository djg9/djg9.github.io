    <h2>Giovanni de Medici, founder of the Medici Bank</h2>
    <p>The Medici family rose to power in the early fifteenth century in the city-state of Florence, which was an independent republic within the Kingdom of Italy, itself part of the overarching Holy Roman Empire at the time. The family first rose to prominence in Florence when Giovanni de Medici founded the Medici Bank, which made the family one of the wealthiest in Europe and was the largest bank in all of Europe at its peak. His son Cosimo de Medici became Gran Maestro (ruler) of Florence in 1434. The family helped the early Renaissance along by sponsoring artists and using personal funds to further the young <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanism">Humanist movement</a>, a cultural revolution characterized by belief in the potential value and goodness of human beings, an emphasis on common human needs, and seeking solely rational means of solving human problems. A significant portion of the art and architecture produced in Florence during the early Italian Renaissance was thanks to the Medici. The prestigious family would go on to rule Florence for the next two hundred years, throughout the rest of the Renaissance, sponsoring some of history's greatest works of art and artists, including:</p> 
    <u1>
        <li>Leonardo da Vinci</li> 
        <li>Michaelangelo</li> 
        <li>Brunelleschi</li> 
        <li>Raphael</li> 
        <li>Donatello</li>
    </u1>
    <p>and also some of the era's revolutionary scientists and astronomers, such as Galileo Galilei.</p>
